Binary search trees, sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of container: a data structure that stores items in memory."

Mostly, these algorithms are used for optimization. Before solving the in-hand sub-problem, dynamic algorithm will try to examine the results of the previously solved sub-problems."
