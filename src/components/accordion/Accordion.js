                        <p>Yes, you will. In the current day and age, employers have an eye for actual talent and skill and a certificate of completion of one of our professional courses does indeed affirm your skills.

                        <p> We believe in 100% refund policy in case of disconnectivity. But due to payment processing and extra services of onboarding, we will deduct 5% for the same.

                        <p>You certainly can. Although owing to the rigorous curriculum of the courses, we would advise you to stick to one course at a time, finish it and apply for the next one afterwards.
